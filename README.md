### _Announcement_

Project officially launched!

### _Project Description_

This is my first postÔºÅI'm so excited to write it down this! : ) 
 I wanna create a coding developer log that everyone can understand.This is a note suitable for all beginners! 
 We will start learning from python, then learn numpy,  pandas and machine learning framewor#ks. Sounds cool! (ARE YOU SURE? lol )
I will try to write this log more interestingly. Some may not be so interesting, BUT you must stick to it! (I believe U! )

### _Why I write this?_

* I wanna more people to participate in the programming community
* I also want to help more people learn to program more deeply
* I wanna help others and exercise my abilities in them.   You can also share this note with more people. Your support is my driving force! 

### _FAQ_

If you have any suggestions, you can get in touch with me. I'm very willing to do better!
