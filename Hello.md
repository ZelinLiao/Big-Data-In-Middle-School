# Project Description

This is my first post！I'm so excited to write it down this! : ) 
 I wanna create a coding developer log that everyone can understand.This is a note suitable for all beginners! 
 We will start learning from python, then learn numpy,  pandas and machine learning framewor#ks. Sounds cool! (ARE YOU SURE? lol )
I will try to write this log more interestingly. Some may not be so interesting, BUT you must stick to it! (I believe U! )

# Why I write this?

I want more people to participate in the programming community， I also want to help more people learn to program more deeply, and help others and exercise my abilities in them.   You can also share this note with more people. Your support is my driving force! 

# FAQ

If you have any suggestions, you can get in touch with me. I'm very willing to do better!
